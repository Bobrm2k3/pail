This is a VERY incomplete list of pail commands and only includes the core ones that need reference material
Most will work via channel messages, some will work via query


Set autoresponse:
  !<trigger> !<response>
  -When the text in trigger is said verbatim(not case sensitive, end punctuation is ignored), bot will print the response
  -The trigger will take precendence over all other commands
  -limit of 5 responses saved to a unique trigger
  -can be set via query
  -Response can include the following tokens that will be dynamically replaced when it is triggered
    $nick - the nick of the person who triggers it
    $someone - a random nick in the channel
    $bot - the bot's name when it is triggered
    $chan - the channel name where it is triggered
    $quote - the text used to trigger it
    $me - if it is the first thing in response, it makes the response a /me
  -example:
    <~Syd> !hi !$me high fives $nick
    <@pail> trigger/response registered
    ...
    <@Oooch> hi
    * @pail high fives Oooch
    
  
  
Store text permanantly:
  !store <name> <text>
  -the text is stored under the name used, certain names are reserved and a message will tell you so
  -example:
    <~Syd> !store cah http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
    <@pail> Saved
    <~Syd> !recall cah
    <@pail> http://pyz.socialgamer.net/game.jsp
  
  
Recall permanant text:
  !recall <name>
  -bot will print the text saved to that name with the !store or .txt command
  -the name is not case sensitive
  -can use wildcards(*) in the name to do a search of saved names

  
Save a user.txt:
  .txt <lines>
  -Short hand to save the last thing said under <their nick>.txt
  -'lines' argument is optional, saves that many previous lines from that nick
  -example:
    <@Joracy> I'm probably going to die alone
    <~Syd> .txt
    <@pail> Saved
    <~Syd> !recall Joracy.txt
    <@pail> <Joracy> I'm probably going to die alone
    
    
Recall a user.txt:
  <nick>.txt
  -returns a saved .txt from that nick
  -Inludes the ID number of that .txt for downvoting
  
  
Vote on the quality of a .txt:
  !downvote <ID number>
  !upvote <ID number>
  -Adds a vote to the .txt with the ID specified
  -Deletes at -5
 
 
Generate markov chain of a user's or channel's messages
  !markov <channel or nick>
  What would <channel or nick> say?
  -might be a bit slow to compute
  -requires the user or channel has said at least 100 lines
  
 
Set timer:
  !timer <positive integer> (seconds|minutes|hours) <message>
  -bot will highlight you in the same channel after the time has elapsed with the message
  -example:
    <~Syd> !timer 5 minutes check on cookies
    <@pail> Maybe I'll remind you
    ... (5 minutes later)
    <@pail> Syd, check on cookies
 
 
Give something to the bot:
  /me (give|hand|gift)s? <botName> <item>
  or
  /me (give|hand|gift)s? <item> to <botName>
  -the bot might accept what you give it and add to its hoard
  -it may give something back from its hoard

  
Take something from the bot:
  /me (robs|mugs|steals from) <botName>
  -the bot will give you something if you spare it a beating
  -is on a lockout timer
  

Get source code:
  !source
  -bot will send you the source code via DCC, it is in a .7z file so make sure your IRC client accepts those
  
  
Check if site is legitimate
  !legit <url>
  -checks google's safebrowsing API for it the site hosts malware or phishing attempts
  
  
Send proxy message to an offline nick:
  !message <nick> <message>
  -bot will relay that message when that person joins the channel you sent the command from
  -example:
    <~Syd> !message shyan Accept my aid
    <@pail> I might get around to delivering that message
    ...
    * Shyan (eZe@coldfront-2606F3CD.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #podn
    <@pail> Message to Shyan [2013/10/13 15:23 EST] <Syd> Accept my aid
